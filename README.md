# JavaScript-Course

This course provided a strong foundation in core web development technologies HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”through hands-on, project-based learning. I developed a portfolio website along with interactive applications such as a calculator, a pizza menu, and a Tic Tac Toe game.

These projects allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in practical ways, deepening my understanding of how content is structured, styled, and made interactive on the web. JavaScript proved especially valuable for building dynamic user experiences and will be central to my future in software or web development.

The most rewarding part was turning code into real, functioning tools.
